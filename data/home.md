# Constructed Desolation -

### Â· Extreme Mood Swings, Miserable, Nostalgic Desolation, Constructed Desolation, Lost, Disgraceful, Fidgety in a Miserable Way, are a few words that partially describe my state right now, No one seem's to care about me, it's like I'm being buried, but I'm the one whose burying myself... It's true no one cares, I just care way too much for my good and for the others as well.

#### Sometimes... Actually most of time, we tend to think that everyone is on to us which is known as the spotlight effect, especially me, I have been socially awkward and shy, sometimes most people overthink a lot, they develop unhealthy ammount of affection over other people, crave for attention, want to be on the top of world... everyone's been there, but most of time, that person probably hates you, no one care about you, and some people are just better, it's hard to wake up to reality, it's hard to accept that you're not the best, no one cares, and when you die... What happens next? you loved ones will.... mabye your not loved, mabye no one ever card, mabye some people are just glad you died, no one is crying... even if they are, you'll be forgotten very soon, so what's the point of life? Nothing? Well, if that hurts already, imagine being forgetten when your alive, ignorance is equal to the most horrible type of pain, as a little bit of a Machiavellian myself, I couldn't dominate most or even some of the aspects of my life before, but now I realized... I was just overthinking, just because I was not so loud, and assertive or awkard as I told you before, I thought they were ignoring me, but I couldn't let my voice be heard, I just had to raise my voice, self-esteem and confidence, but I didn't, so this took place about Late 2021 - Early 2023, I went down the dark path, I learnt about psychopathy, narcissism, machiavellianism, sadism, emotional detachement, etc... and started adapting the traits, learnt manipulation, deception and more, I start philosophy Mid 2023, now after look at my past, It was worth it, I have learnt something that most people do late, note I was 10 at pandemic (2020), now I'm 12-13, so it is a big deal, so in this series of Psychology and Manily Philosophy, we'll explore dark traits, emotional detachement, stoicisms, etc... Even though I haven't acquired full knowledge on these topics, I'll try my best to Explain my SeA Theory, which WILL take your life to the next step in the terms of the Mind, and control over your self... That's it for now ðŸŽ­
